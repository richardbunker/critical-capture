## Critical Captures
Critical Capture was built using Next.js which is a full-stack React.js framework. This project is written in TypeScript and connects to a PlanetScale database via Prisma. This project helped me obtain a better understanding of Next.js including its strengths and weaknesses. Prisma ORM is one of the best in the business! I absolutely loved the intellisense with constructing queries using TypeScript! Also through Next.js 13 I was able to have a play around with React.js's new server rendered components and how to use them in conjunction with client rendered components.

Things I'm super proud of:

- Implements the new Next.js 13 'App' router
- React Server & Client Components
- Use of scalable MySQL database via PlanetScale
- Implements one-to-many, and many-to-many SQL relationships
- Next.js credentials authentication
- Learning how Next.js caches its resources was key for completing this learning project. It also gave me a chance to understand how Vercel's serverless edge - - functions work under the hood. This is still bleeding edge technology, but it was a great opportunity to experience an alternative way to build a full-stack using these modern approaches.
